INITIAL DD REVIEW
- add overview/product description
- need to assign specific roles/functions to group members
- password should not be primary key
- save login state with cookies
- add logout functionality
- (outdated? we're not doing wikis anymore, but i'll still write this) need db for wikis to check edit/site history
- component map should have frontend at the top and backend at the bottom
- component map needs deeper explanation of component relations
